# CystinosisDetector
Cystinosis Disease Detector: Eye analysis through Computer Vision

The data structure must be the following:
 1. All the scripts have to be in the folder src
 2. All the forlder with data must be in the folder data

The project has been divided in two parts:

### Comparing two patients
The first option in the Main.m file. Data from two patients is compared and outputs some figures that will help a doctor with the diagnosis of the  evolution of the disease.

### Analyzing a patient
The second option in the Main.m file. All data from a single patient is analyzed and gives information about its actual state (number of crystals, intensity of those crystals, location... )

## Functioning
Run the Main.m file with a Matlab interpreter.

If you want to work with new data, you have to put them in the Data folder and it will be available to work with it.

## Aditional information
The main.mlx file is a matlab live script in which is shown how the analysis proces is carried out step by step.


Caution: The evaluation is done eye against eye, so is better to have different folders in data and each one has up to 25 images of different sections of one eye.
