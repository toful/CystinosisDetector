# CystinosisDetector
Cystinosis Disease Detector: Eye analysis through Computer Vision 

There is two files to use. 
 - The step by step JPython like book that details
   the different steps of the algorithms (main.xlm)
 - The Main.m script that can be used to perform the different evaluations

The data structure must be the following:
 1. All the scripts have to be in the folder src
 2. All the forlder with data must be in the folder data
    

Caution: The evaluation is done eye against eye, so is better to have different
folders in data and each one has up to 25 images of different sections of one eye.
